# SkySync - Making Planes Less Boring

*** **First Place in Purdue's Hello World - 2023 Hackathon** ***

*Developed by Krish Shah, Christopher Lee, and Caleb Buening*

  In this new day and age, full of AI, ML, and other new technological solutions, there remain a tragic amount of unsolved
problems. World hunger, deforestation, death, disease, depression, and more. With these sorts of competitions, there is
ample opportunity for new, original solutions. "But why be like everyone else?" we asked ourselves? "What would make us
stand apart?" Fixing first world problems.

  Today we present to you: SkySync - The Ultimate Solution to your flight boredom. Have a friend? Maybe even two? Download
SkySync before your flight and take advantage of our suite of bluetooth powered software. It's a federal offense to play
your wifi-connected games, so be a good, law-abiding citizen, crack open your phone, and have some fun with your flight buddies.

  Looking for more? Join the **Sky High Society** (coming to the app store soon) for only $6.99 / month and get access to our entire suite of games!


### Future
Although this repository hasn't been updated, this app is still in development and will be put onto the app store in early 2024.
This repository is just a showcase of what our hackathon project looked like, but the actual app will be closed source for now.
